# ECE470_Project
ECE 470 Project for Chen Qian, Junkai Zhang and Zheyuan Zhang.
This project use a UR3 robot (whether in Gazebo Simulator or Reality) to spray disinfectant on certain object. The UR3 driver and model is sourced from ECE 470 Lab project and modified. [Link](http://coecsl.ece.illinois.edu/ece470/)

## Configure the environment

In linux, firstly [install ROS-Kinetic](http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic/Installation)

Then install the dependent packages that required:

[ros_control](http://wiki.ros.org/ros_control?distro=kinetic#Install) and [moveit](https://moveit.ros.org/install/)

After that, create a new folder by 

1. ```mkdir catkin_ws``` and use `cd catkin_ws` to get into the folder. Then `mkdir src` and `cd src` to create `src` folder and get into it.
2. Download the files, extract it in src folder.
3. `cd ..` to get in the root directory of catkin_ws. Use `catkin_make` to compile the whole project.
4. To run the code, firstly, `source devel/setup.bash` and launch ros by `roslaunch ur3_driver ur3_gazebo.launch` for simulator, or `roslaunch ur3_driver ur3_driver.launch` for real UR3 robot. In another window, also `source devel/setup.bash` and run the code by `rosrun CTRL_py main_exec.py`

# Our Work

Our code are mostly lie in the `directory /src/CTRL_py/scripts/`, but we also slightly modified the ur3 urdf file in `src\drivers\universal_robot\ur_description\urdf\ur3.urdf.xacro`, to install the sensors and effectors we need.

# TODO List

- [x] Configure the environment
- [x] Install sensor
- [x] Drive motors on UR3
- [ ] Kinematics
- [ ] End Effector
- [ ] Logic Algorithm
